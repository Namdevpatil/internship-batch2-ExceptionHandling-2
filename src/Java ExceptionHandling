Question: Why we use Exception Handling in Java?

Answer: To maintain the normal flow of a java program execution.

=> To implement ExceptionHandling in java we use,

- blocks:
	- try block: it has problematic part
	- catch block: it has handler part
	- finally block: it has resource/connection release/close mandatory statements.
	
- keywords:
	 - throws: use to declare exceptions(predefined/user defined) classes with method signature/header.
	 - throw: use to define/create an Exception object in method body.

-The 'Throwable' class is the superclass/root class of all errors and 
 exceptions in the Java language.
 
 Throwable class has two sub classes, they are Error and Exception
 
-Java Exceptions are divided into 2 types:
		- predefined exceptions: exceptions classes part of the JRE libraries
				- Checked Exceptions: 
							Except RuntimeException and its sub classes, whatever remaining exceptions there in Exception class, those are called checked exceptions.
				- Unchecked Exceptions: 
							- Runtime exceptions and its sub classes
		- user-defined exceptions: exceptions which are created based on predefined exceptions
